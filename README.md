Why a herringbone shader?

I read this talking about the virtues of herribone Wang tiles: https://nothings.org/gamedev/herringbone/herringbone_tiles.html

So I thought this is one way to make a material that isn't a repeating pattern.

This doesn't currently do anything for edge-matching, it just assumes any tile can be swapped in, so it's not quite Wang tiles, but it does have herringbone tiling.
